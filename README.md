# My-Todo-app
A simple Todo app made in React js to practice Reacts main concepts and some advanced concepts.
This is part of a series called [100 days of React](https://dev.to/sianwa11/100-days-of-react-1e00) which is an attempt to learn as much as I possibly can in 100 days.
The live demo can be found [here](https://my-todo-list11.netlify.app/)
